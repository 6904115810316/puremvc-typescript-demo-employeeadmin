## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) [TypeScript](https://github.com/puremvc/puremvc-typescript-standard-framework/wiki) Demo: Employee Admin (jQuery)
This demo illustrates techniques for performing routine client-side maintenance operations in a PureMVC-based TypeScript jQuery application.

PureMVC framework and Employee Admin demo library files are loaded using Require.js. UI components
are displayed using jQuery, jQuery UI and jQgrid.

The demo is compiled as an AMD module using an Ant script that palliate TypeScript compiler
issues building a single module using multiple TypeScript files. TypeScript will probably evolve on
this point in a near future. The demo will be tested and updated on each new TypeScript compiler
release. If it's not sufficiently up to date for you, please open an issue on Github or just send a
pull request by your own, this will be more than welcome.
